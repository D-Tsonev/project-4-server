      "description": "The violin is the smallest and highest-pitched of the instruments in the string family. It is related to a North African instrument called a rebab (a three-stringed instrument also played with a bow drawn across the strings). Violins have been traditionally used as an accompaniment to singing and dancing. It is also an important classical solo instrument, as well as taking pride of place at the front of orchestras. When played, the violin is held under the chin and the fingers of the left hand press the strings on the neck of the instrument to produce different pitches when the string is bowed or plucked. The bow is held in the right hand and it is drawn across the strings at right angles to make them sound.",

The viola has four strings but is larger and produces a deeper sound than the violin. As well as being an important part of the orchestral string section, the viola is a popular solo instrument in chamber music.",

However, it is much larger and cellists usually play the instrument seated with the body of the cello placed between the legs. Modern cellos usually have an endpin, a spike that supports the instrument on the floor. In the Baroque era (1600–1750), the cello was used largely to accompany other instruments. Later, in works by composers such as Beethoven and Brahms, the cello became an expressive solo instrument in its own right.",

The basic structure of the harp is a set of strings stretched over a frame. The harpist plucks or strums the strings to produce the notes. Harps vary from large, ornate orchestral models with pedals, to small portable varieties. In an orchestra, a single harp is used in the string section and can be played as a solo instrument. In Irish folk music, the harp is an iconic instrument often used to accompany songs and is the national symbol of Ireland.",

From Spanish flamenco and accompanying folksongs to taking the spotlight as a solo instrument in classical works, the story of the acoustic guitar mirrors that of Western music. The guitar consists of a hollow wooden body with six strings stretched over it and along a narrow neck. Guitars usually have a single, round sound hole in the body. The strings can be strummed with the fingers or plucked. Some guitarists use a plectrum (triangular piece of plastic) to sound the strings.",

      "description": "The modern metal flute has its roots in the simple instruments made of bone, wood, or clay that were played by our ancestors thousands of years ago. Now a finely honed metal instrument, the flute’s smooth, bright sound can be heard at the top of the woodwind section. In the 19th century, instrument makers began experimenting with key systems in the search for a more powerful flute, with more reliable tuning. A flute-maker called Theobald Boehm invented a system that is still used on most modern flutes today. The modern flute has just over three octaves and is usually pitched in C. There are larger, lower-pitched flutes (alto) and smaller, high-pitched ones (the piccolo). Standard C-pitched instruments are formed of three sections (joints) that fit together: the head, body, and foot. Flutes are widely played in classical music, as well as jazz and traditional Celtic music, for which softer-toned wooden instruments are preferred.",

To produce a sound, the oboist places the tip of the reed (made from a bamboo-like cane) between the lips and blows through the tiny hole. Many oboists make their own reeds, as each player needs a slightly different form. The oboe has a range a little lower than that of the flute. It is a key part of the orchestral woodwind section and is also a solo instrument in its own right.",

The large clarinet family ranges from the contrabass, which plays the lowest range of notes, to the piccolo clarinet, which plays the highest. Like the saxophone, the clarinet is a single reed instrument. Players blow into the narrow gap between the reed and mouthpiece causing the reed to vibrate and produce a sound. The modern clarinet uses a system of rings and keys, to allow the clarinettist to play a wide range of notes. There are four main sections that make up the clarinet (from top to bottom): the barrel, upper joint, lower joint, and bell. The standard clarinet is in B flat and is used in most styles of music. Clarinets are also made in A, which are more often used in orchestras and chamber music.",

The reed is connected to the body of the instrument by a curved metal tube, called a crook. There are four sections, or joints, of a bassoon that fit together (from top to bottom): the bell, bass, wing, and butt. A complex system of keys is controlled by the player’s hands to produce different notes.",

Instead, it was embraced wholeheartedly by jazz and swing bands, becoming popular as a solo instrument, and today, plays a part in most styles of music. Adolphe Sax invented 14 different saxophones that were divided into seven types (from smallest to largest): sopranino, soprano, alto, tenor, baritone, bass, and contrabass. They all have the keys in the same place, so once you can play one, you should be able to play them all!",

Old trumpet-like instruments played by ancient peoples were made of conch-shell, animal horn, wood or metal. Throughout history the trumpet has been used to sound alarms, gather people together, as a call to war, and to add luster to parade music. Like the violin, the trumpet is the smallest member of its family and plays the highest pitches with its bright and vibrant sound. Today's modern trumpet is a slender brass pipe with three attached valves, which is curved and bent into long loops. If you stretched out the trumpet to its full length, it would be 6 ½ feet long! There are 2 to 4 trumpets in an orchestra and they play both melody and harmony and also support the rhythm. You play the trumpet by holding it horizontally, buzzing your lips into the mouthpiece, and pressing down the three valves in various combinations to change pitch.",

The French horn's 18 feet of tubing is rolled up into a circular shape, with a large bell at its end. There are anywhere from 2 to 8 French horns in an orchestra, and they play both melody and harmony as well as rhythm. To play the French horn, hold it with the bell curving downward and buzz into the mouthpiece. Your left hand plays the three valves and you can change the type of sound you make by the way you place your right hand in the bell.",

Two U-shaped pipes are linked at opposite ends to form an \"S.\" One pipe slides into the other so the total length of the pipe can be extended or shortened. You play the trombone by holding it horizontally, buzzing into the mouthpiece, and using your right hand to change pitch by pushing or pulling the slide to one of seven different positions. If you stretch the trombone out straight, it is about 9 feet long. There are usually 3 trombones in the orchestra and they play pitches in the same range as the cello and bassoon. The three trombones often play harmonies together.",

Standard tubas have about 16 feet of tubing. There is generally only one tuba in an orchestra and it usually plays harmony. You play the tuba sitting down with the instrument on your lap and the bell facing up.
